Apple introduced SwiftUI during WWDC 19, It is an innovative simpler way to build user interfaces for ios products. Therefore I decided to explore this fairly new technology by building a slot matching Game using SwiftUI. Before diving in, it is key to note that SwiftUI only supports ios13 or above.



The Slot Matching Game consists of 9 cards in the center of the interface, the user will have an initial credit of 100 points with two betting options, one minimum bet option which costs 10 points, another one maximum bet option costs 20 points. User gain points if a row of images matches, in contrast, User lose points if the image didnâ€™t match.
